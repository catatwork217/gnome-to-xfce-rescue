# GNOME-to-XFCE Linux Rescue & Rebuild Toolkit

This repo contains real-world scripts and recovery steps to:
- Recover from GNOME session corruption or boot failure
- Fully purge GNOME and GDM
- Install and lock XFCE as the default desktop environment
- Harden your system with ClamAV, UFW, SMART, and more
- Set up post-install automation and dotfile consistency

Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Framework16 laptop.

## Why I Created This

After losing my desktop environment and getting trapped in TTY loops, I rebuilt my Linux system from the ground up and documented every step. This toolkit turns chaos into clean XFCE-powered clarity.
